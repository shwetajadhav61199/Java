/*Design a class hierarchy for a simple online shopping system. The base class should be
Product and it should have subclasses for Book, Clothing, and Electronics. The Product
class should have a method for calculating the price of the product, and the subclasses
should have methods for calculating shipping costs. Use dynamic method dispatch to call
the correct method for each product.*/
